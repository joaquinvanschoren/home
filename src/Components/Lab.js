              Iâ€™m fortunate to work with an amazing team. Me and my research group on <i>Advanced Models through Open Research and Engineering</i> (AMORE) 
              aim to scientifically understand and build AI systems with advanced capabilities, and make AI accessible to benefit all of humanity.
              We invent new neural network architectures and train them in new ways to learn better and faster, study models systematically, 
              and use our insights to automate this process so that AI systems can self-assemble and optimize themselves. Everything we create 
              is open-source and crafted with user-friendliness in mind. You can <a href="#pubs">find our work</a> in top AI conferences and journals, and 
              we take pride in good engineering and open science to build AI models and systems that are widely used by people every day.
